# Global Risk Pooling Can Mitigate Drought-Related Financial Risk for Hydropower-Dependent Countries
This repository contains materials used for the analysis in Using Remote Sensing to Develop a Global Risk Pool for Hydropower-Dependent Countries (Cuppari, R.I., Pavelsky, T.M., Characklis, G.W.). The objective of this analysis is to use remotely sensed data to design index insurance contracts at the country-level for hydropower dependent countries. These contracts were then pooled to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pooled insurance relative to individually held contracts and relative to self-insurance (i.e., holding reserves). Results suggest that hydrometeorological data relevant to both water supply and electricity demand (i.e., precipitation, temperature, snow cover extent, and vegetation indices) can be used to develop index insurance contracts that can be pooled to provide an average savings of 85% in comparison to each pool member holding individual reserves.

Remotely sensed data used as inputs can be found in the following locations: 
- Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG)
- Normalized Difference Snow Index (MOD10CM): https://nsidc.org/data/mod10cm/versions/61
- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index (MOD13C2): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13c2v061/
- Land Surface Temperature (MOD11C3): https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/lpcloud-mod11c3-006
