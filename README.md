# Using Remote Sensing to Develop a Global Risk Pool for Hydropower-Dependent Countries
This repository contains materials used for the analysis in Using Remote Sensing to Develop a Global Risk Pool for Hydropower-Dependent Countries (Cuppari, R.I., Pavelsky, T.M., Characklis, G.W.).

Remotely sensed data used as inputs can be found in the following locations: 
- Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG)
- Normalized Difference Snow Index (MOD10CM): https://nsidc.org/data/mod10cm/versions/61
- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index (MOD13C2): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13c2v061/
- Land Surface Temperature (MOD11B3): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod11b3v006/

Additional geospatial data can be found at: 
- The Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD): https://doi.org/10.1890/100125
- HydroBASINS: https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.9740
